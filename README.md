The codes in this repositry are the ones I used in my MSc project, where:


Download_GSV.ipynb is the code I wrote to download the GSV images from the provided map in the folde "road map".
training_model.ipynb is the code used to setup and train the model needed.
Object_detection_image.py is the code used to scan the dataset for manhole covers.
monodepth_simple.py is the code used to convert the detected samples to depth maps for distance estimation.
depth_and_location_estimation.ipynb is the code used to extract the distance for the detected objects from the generated depth maps.
