The codes in this repositry are the ones I used in my MSc project, where:


**Download_GSV.ipynb** is the code I wrote to download the GSV images from the provided map in the folde "**road map**".<br />
**training_model.ipynb** is the code used to setup and train the model needed.<br />
**Object_detection_image.py** is the code used to scan the dataset for manhole covers.<br />
**monodepth_simple.py** is the code used to convert the detected samples to depth maps for distance estimation.<br />
**depth_and_location_estimation.ipynb** is the code used to extract the distance for the detected objects from the generated depth maps.<br />
